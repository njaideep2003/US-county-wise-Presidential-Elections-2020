### 1. US map shapefile:
US county shapefile source: https://gist.github.com/sdwfrost/d1c73f91dd9d175998ed166eb216994a


### 2. Handling Datasets:
- The raw data file `2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv` was downloaded from https://data.gov
- So I handled the missing data values of some counties in 'winner_color' with the most common winner color and filled empty spaces (NaN values) with 0 and saved it as `2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results_filled.csv`.

 ### 3. Visualizations:
